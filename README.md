# Retina_Classification
Machine Learning project to classify whether the provided image is an image of a healthy retina or not. 


Motivation: 

This project is quite personal for me. On a Friday of October of 2021, around 4PM, I went in for a routine eye exam. Everything was going well until my doctor (optometrist) starts to check the back of my eyes. I notice she's taking quite a while to inspect them. I ask, "Is everything okay?". She says, "I think you might have a retinal tear". At this time I had no idea of what this was or what it meant, as a result I was scared. 

I was rushed to hospital to see a retinal specialist. Again, it was a Friday evening so most of them are gone home, but she managed to find someone on call at a hospital. 

I got there and the retinal specialist examined my retina. She calls up another specialist to take a look aswell. Both of these doctors conclude, there is no tear and it's just lattice (lattice degeneration). 

It took 3 doctors, to classify whether I have a retinal tear or not. Since then, I've been factinated by eyes and their complexity. As a result, I've taken on this project of classifiying whether a retina is healthy or not, wihtout knowing any intricacies that maybe present or having any domain knowledge. 

Since then, I've also had a deeper appreciation for the human body :).
