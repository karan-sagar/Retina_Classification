# Retina_Classification
Machine Learning project to classify whether the provided image is an image of a healthy retina or not. 


Motivation: 

This project is deeply personal to me. On a Friday afternoon in October 2021, I went in for a routine eye exam. Everything seemed normal until my optometrist began examining the back of my eyes. She took an unusually long time, and I asked, "Is everything okay?" She responded, "I think you might have a retinal tear." At that moment, I had no idea what this meant, and I was understandably frightened.

I was quickly referred to a hospital to see a retinal specialist. Since it was Friday evening, most specialists had already left for the day, but fortunately, someone on call was found.

I got there and the retinal specialist examined my retina. The retinal specialist consulted another expert for a second opinion. Both of these doctors conclude, there is no tear and it's just lattice (lattice degeneration).

It took the expertise of three doctors to classify whether I have a retinal tear or not. This experience sparked my fascination with the complexity of the human eye (and human body in general). As a result, I've embarked on this project to classify whether a retina is healthy, despite lacking intricate domain knowledge.

Since then, I've also had a deeper appreciation for the human body :).
